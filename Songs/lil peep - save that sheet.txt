Fuck my life, can't save that girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't getting nothing that I'm saying
Don't tell me you is
Nothing like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothing like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothing like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Fuck my life, can't save that girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't getting nothing that I'm saying
Don't tell me you is
Nothing like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road to home
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glow? Baby, we could glow
Fuck my life, can't save that girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback
For the way I always play that shit
You ain't getting nothing that I'm saying
Don't tell me you is
Nothing like them other motherfuckers
